## Key Analysis & Insights

### 1. Travel Readiness Score
A composite **Travel Readiness Score** was created using passport availability, income band, property rating, and asset ownership.  
Customers in the highest readiness segment convert at **25%**, significantly higher than the overall average, validating readiness-based lead prioritization.

### 2. Income Band Impact
Conversion rate increases consistently from **Low → Medium → High income bands**, showing that purchasing power is a strong determinant of conversion.

### 3. Follow-up Effectiveness
Moderate to high follow-up levels improve conversion, but returns diminish beyond a point, indicating the need for optimized follow-up strategies.

### 4. Age Group Trends
Middle-aged customers (35–54) show higher conversion compared to younger and older segments, suggesting better alignment with product pricing and intent.

### 5. Pitch Duration
Longer pitches are associated with higher conversion, likely because they occur with already-interested customers rather than causing conversion themselves.
