# ✈️ Travel Product Conversion Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was completed **during my data analytics training** as an end-to-end analysis focused on understanding the key drivers of customer conversion for a travel product.

The project was **recently refined and uploaded to GitHub** to showcase structured analysis, customer segmentation, and dashboard-driven business insights.

## 🎯 Business Problem

A travel services company wants to:
- Improve customer conversion rates  
- Identify high-potential customer segments  
- Optimize sales follow-up strategies  
- Prioritize leads more effectively  

Currently, sales efforts are applied uniformly across customers, leading to inefficiencies.

## 📂 Dataset Description

- **Data Type:** Customer and sales interaction data  
- **Records:** 824 customers  
- **Key Attributes:**  
  - Demographics (Age, Income)  
  - Sales interactions (Pitch duration, Follow-ups)  
  - Readiness indicators (Passport, Assets, Property rating)  
  - Conversion outcome (Product Taken)

---

## 🗂 Data Structure

The analysis follows a structured pipeline:
- **Raw Data** – Original dataset  
- **Cleaned_data** – Missing values handled and formats standardized  
- **Analysis_data** – Segmentation and derived indicators added  
- **Analysis_summary** – KPIs and pivot-based aggregations  
- **Dashboard** – Visual representation of conversion drivers  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Dashboarding)

## 🔍 Analysis Approach

- Cleaned and prepared raw customer data  
- Created customer segments based on age, income, and behavior  
- Designed a composite **Travel Readiness Score** using multiple indicators  
- Analyzed conversion rates across key segments  
- Built a decision-focused dashboard  

### Analysis Areas
- Customer segmentation  
- Sales effort effectiveness  
- Lead prioritization  
- Conversion rate analysis

## ❓ Key Business Questions Answered

- What is the overall customer conversion rate?  
- Which customer segments convert at higher rates?  
- Does income influence conversion likelihood?  
- How effective are follow-ups and pitch duration?  
- Can customer readiness predict conversion?  

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Overall conversion rate is approximately **16.7%**  
- High travel readiness customers convert at **25%**, significantly above average  
- Conversion increases consistently with higher income bands  
- Moderate to high follow-up levels improve conversion outcomes  
- Middle-aged customers (35–54) show higher conversion likelihood

## 💡 Business Recommendations

- Prioritize high-readiness and high-income customers for sales outreach  
- Use readiness-based lead scoring to allocate sales effort  
- Optimize follow-up strategies to avoid diminishing returns  
- Align product offerings with high-conversion age segments  

---

## ⚠ Limitations

- No time-series data for trend or seasonality analysis  
- No cost or profitability information  
- Analysis limited to available customer attributes  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Automate readiness scoring logic  
- Extend analysis with time-based or cohort data  
- Build dashboards in Power BI or Tableau  
- Apply predictive models for conversion likelihood
