# Travel Product Conversion Analysis

## Overview
This project was completed **during my data analytics training** as an end-to-end analysis exercise focused on understanding the key drivers of customer conversion for a travel product.

The project has been **recently uploaded to GitHub** after refining the analysis, improving pivot structures, and designing a clean, decision-focused dashboard suitable for portfolio presentation.

## Key Analysis & Insights

### 1. Travel Readiness Score
As part of the training exercise, a composite **Travel Readiness Score** was created using passport availability, income band, property rating, and asset ownership.  
Customers in the highest readiness segment showed a **25% conversion rate**, significantly higher than the overall average, validating readiness-based lead prioritization.

### 2. Income Band Impact
Conversion rates increased consistently from **Low → Medium → High income bands**, indicating that purchasing power plays a major role in conversion likelihood.

### 3. Follow-up Effectiveness
Moderate to high follow-up levels resulted in better conversion outcomes, while excessive follow-ups showed diminishing returns.

### 4. Age Group Trends
Customers in the **35–54 age group** demonstrated higher conversion compared to younger and older segments.

### 5. Pitch Duration
Longer pitch durations were associated with higher conversion, likely reflecting higher intent customers rather than pitch length alone.
